    The class is used to implement the controller pattern in snapping_sheet library is snappingSheetController.
    SnappingSheetController allows the developer to:
	- Return true if the snapping sheet is currently trying to snap to a position.
	- Getting the current position of the sheet.
	- Getting the current snapping position of the sheet.
	- The hash code for this object.
	- Check if a state is attached to this controller.
	- A representation of the runtime type of the object.
